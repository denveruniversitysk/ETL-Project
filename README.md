**Project Title:**

Crime Rate Statistics in New York Vs. Denver

**Team Members:**

Project Status: Solo

**Project Description/Outline:**

I will be utilizing datasets that look at crime rate in New York versus Denver. I will look at different areas within New York and Denver to determine crime rate among various counties and neighborhoods.

**Research Questions to Answer:**

1. What is the crime rate in New York?
2. What is the crime rate in Denver?
3. Is the crime rate in Denver more prevalent among certain neighborhoods?
4. Is the crime rate in New York more prevalent among certain counties?
5. What are the statistics of crime rate between both states? 
6. Does Denver have the highest crime rate versus New York (or vice versa)?

**Resources Used:**

1. https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/denver-crime-data
2. https://crime.denverpost.com/neighborhood
3. https://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/countycrimestats.htm

3. 2020_denver_neighborhood_violent_crime_rates.csv
4. 2020_denver_property_crime_rates.csv

All datasets above are in .csv formate - saved under ETL-Datasets.

I will be adding to the existing datasets, as I'm still in the process of researching.

**Rough Breakdown of Tasks:**

1. Extract datasets
2. Transform datasets
3. Load datasets
