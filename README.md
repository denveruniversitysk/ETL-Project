**Project Title:**

Crime Rate Statistics in New York versus Denver

**Team Members:**

Project Status: Solo

**Project Description/Outline:**

I will be utilizing datasets that look at crime rate in New York versus Denver. I will look at different areas within New York and Denver to determine if crime rate is more prevalent in low-income cities versus high-income cities across both states.

**Research Questions to Answer:**

1. What is the crime rate in New York?
2. What is the crime rate in Denver?
3. Does the crime rate in Denver differ between low income cities versus high income cities?
4. Does the crime rate in New York differ between low income cities versus high income cities?
5. What are the statistics of crime rate between both cities? Does Denver have the highest crime rate versus New York (or vice versa)?

**Resources Used:**

1. www.kaggle.com
